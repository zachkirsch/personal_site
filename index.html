<p>I'm Zach Kirsch, a junior at Tufts University, pursuing a B.S. in
Computer Science and a B.A. in Math.</p>

<p>Right now I'm studying abroad in Milan, where I'm traveling around Europe.
You can read some updates on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.

<h2>Tufts</h2>

<p>Most of what I know I've learned in my courses at Tufts, where I've become
interested in the theory side of computer science. I've especially enjoyed
<i>Computation Theory</i> with Ben Hescott, <i>Algorithms</i> with Greg
Aloupis, and <i>Computer Systems Security</i> with Ming Chow, where I <a
href="/assets/quantum_risk.pdf" target="_blank">wrote</a> about encryption
methods that are vulnerable to quantum computing.

<p>At Tufts, I spend a lot of my time as a TA. I've always enjoyed teaching,
and I like getting students excited about computer science. Last semester I
TA'ed <i>Introduction to Computer Science</i> and <i>Computation Theory</i> and
had a blast with both.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>Outside the classroom, I've worked on a few projects. I used to participate
in competitive debate, so a lot of what I've done on my own is related to
that. Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.debatehelper.com/mac.html"
       target="_blank">DebateHelper</a> was the first program I ever made.
     It's a Microsoft Word template decked out with VBA 7 that helps
     collaboratively organize and consolidate research.
  </li>
  <li>
    DebateRanker is a system I created for ranking debaters with the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"
    target="_blank">Elo</a> and <a href="http://www.glicko.net/glicko.html"
    target="_blank">Glicko</a> ratings systems. It pulls competition results
    from online sources, normalizes the data, and integrates it into the
    existing rankings. At last count, there were over 70,000 recorded results.
    DebateRanker was acquired by Victory Briefs, where it powers their <a
    href="http://vbriefly.com/rankings/" target="_blank">national debate
    rankings</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Work</h2>

<p>Over the summers, I like to get a feel for what the working world is like
for a programmer. Last summer I worked at Microsoft's Azure Customer Insights;
on a team, I created a tool to mirror SQL stores in a graph model format to
allow for relationship-based querying. This summer I'll be at Palantir Technologies in
Washington, D.C.</p>
